Title="Thrust"
Description="A recreation of the infamous destruction of the Saturn IX PCNR rocket where a crack team of anti-NEG rebels stormed the launch facility and scuttled the rocket by launching it unguided and half-fueled."

[SceneSubtitles0]
SubTitles=("This scenario recreates the premature launching of the half-fueled Saturn IX rocket by anti-NEG rebels.","First, your team must toggle the switch on the roof of this small building to launch the Guidance Rocket, which serves as a necessary navigational beacon for the Main Rocket.","If you wish, you may choose to secure the auxiliary landing pad by destroying two these SAM launchers. If the SAM site is destroyed, your team then may spawn at the landing pad, and an airstrike will drastically weaken the enemy defenses at your next objective.","Place and detonate explosives on the hydraulic pressure tanks. This will open all base doors, and allow access to the facility's main control room.","Finally, you will need to activate the launch switch inside Mission Control before final fueling is complete.  This will scuttle the Main Rocket into an improper launch orbit.")
