Title="The Goopgod Cult Refugium"
Description="For years the Nali monks managed to keep this sacred burial ground hidden from the scavenging Skaarj hoards.  They weren't so lucky with the Liandri, however, and the temple was discovered by a routine satellite sweep in search of useable Tarydium deposits.  The area was mined, and what remained was converted into a tournament arena, corpses and all."
