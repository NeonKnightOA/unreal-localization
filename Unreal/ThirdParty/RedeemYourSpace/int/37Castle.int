Title="Shinigami - Amarok Castle"

[TranslatorEvent0]
Message="My Log: The going gets tough. The castle is now within reach. It's obviously the Skaarj headquarters. I should expect some leader or a Queen."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent1]
Message="My Log: I'm here. I did not expect such a pretty castle. Now I just need to find a way inside. I can see the main entrance. I should look if there's some secret entrance. A crack in the wall or something like that."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent2]
Message="My Log: This one looks like a way in. Obviously someone had dug this in secret. Let's go inside."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent3]
Message="My Log: Prison. Maybe they will have some prisoners. They might have some interesting information."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent4]
Message="My Log: Oh no... a torture chamber! Why does this always have to be part of the prison?..."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent5]
Message="My Log: An electric chair. I'm certainly surprised to find this. Strange, there is no external power hookup. Obviously they have some internal source of energy."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent6]
Message="My Log: The lifts between the floors are controlled from this room."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent7]
Message="Looks like some sort of operational manual. Wish I could read it."
M_NewMessage="Krall notes"
M_TransMessage="Krall notes"

[TranslatorEvent9]
Message="My Log: I'm finally out of that depressing prison. Next will probably be the Storage. Before going any further, I should check the cells. What if a prisoner has some valuable, useful information?"
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent10]
Message="The Skaarj have always been allies with the Tau'ri. The local residents don't have a clue about what they plan to do. If I was able, I would get the Tau'ri location. That information could be in the castle library."
M_NewMessage="Krall notes"
M_TransMessage="Krall notes"

[TranslatorEvent11]
Message="My Log: The Castle's kitchen, large enough for 120 individuals."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent12]
Message="My Log: Finally out of the basement. Well that's a lucky break. I'm in the library. Now a little look around. Surely there will be interesting information."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent13]
Message="My Log: The main entrance is very well protected. It is practically impossible to pass it. I'm glad I went through the back door."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent14]
Message="My Log: The room above looks like a gym. Skaarj will definitely be there."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent15]
Message="The last attack on Sirius was again thwarted by the rebels, coming mostly from the planet Exploited. They got tremendous support by the people of the previously enslaved planet. We will need help from our Tauri allies. They want the Naqahdah deposits."
M_NewMessage="Krall notes"
M_TransMessage="Krall notes"

[TranslatorEvent16]
Message="The old writings say there's a device, located on Soulstone, that can destroy anything after passing through a StarGate. The problem is, nobody knows where it is. Explorers were sent there to find it, and never returned."
M_NewMessage="Krall notes"
M_TransMessage="Krall notes"

[TranslatorEvent17]
Message="My Log: What a mess. Perhaps I'll find something in this technical manual."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent18]
Message="My Log: Finally, an interesting book with descriptions of several planets and their locations. I've visited most of them, but not these: Soulstone and Tauri. I have no idea what to expect."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent19]
Message="My Log: It looks like the fireplace in the style of Pat & Mat. Those guys can do anything well. :-)"
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent20]
Message="My Log: After this, I have the choice to return to home. Yet, the Skaarj might continue and eventually attack Earth. I'll have to go to Soulstone and find the device to destroy the Iris and close the gates forever."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent21]
Message="My Log: The stairs lead deeper down than the lowest floor of the castle. There will be a secret passage for emergency escape. I hope I can get to the gate."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent22]
Message="My Log: This was used to pour hot liquid on enemies trying to conquer the castle. Effective. I've read about similar practices on Earth during the ancient Middle Ages."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent23]
Message="My Log: The main entrance opens here, however, this leads back to the gate, back through Amarok and the forest. I should look for a secret passage. The doors in the basement are not locked."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent24]
Message="My Log: Again, in the tombs..."
