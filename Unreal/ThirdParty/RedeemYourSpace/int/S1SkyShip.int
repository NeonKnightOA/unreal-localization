Message="Stardate 25th July 2084. - As usual, we were transfering prisoners from planet Exploited. Only when we were near planet Madehiten, we picked up a small shuttle. I've ordered to explore it, but it turned out to be a fatal mistake. It was full of Pupae. Those creatures eat biological mass and are capable of eating out entire vegetation on planets. They are developing very quickly, there's just too many of them. Most of the crew is already dead. The Pupae could be only killed by destroying the braking crystals, but that would make the entire ship burn in the atmosphere."
