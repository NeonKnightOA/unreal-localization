Message=There's something odd lately. Some Mercs died under mysterious circumstances. Early it started in the mines, but now it happens in the factories. We all fear something terrible. The last daredevils working in the mines were unable to defend themselves.

Message=Last month: Terrible things. I was in the mines and some of our soldiers were killed by a red phantom. Then I saw a figure with nails in his head. It frightened me and I ran away. Now I drink, but it does not help.
