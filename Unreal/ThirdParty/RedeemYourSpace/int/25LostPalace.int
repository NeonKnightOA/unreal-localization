Message=Shit!!!

[TranslatorEvent0]
Message=My Log: So I'm on the planet Chicken Itza. Mercenaries must have a base here.

[TranslatorEvent1]
Message=My Log: This planet is apparently the smallest habitable. The daily cycle lasts only 14 hours and the temperature can be very high.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent2]
Message=My Log: So, Chicken Itza is literally interwoven with a system of underground tunnels.
M_NewMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent3]
Message=My Log: Similar to Mayan pyramids. Such pyramids are all over the planet. Time to track down the Mercenary hideout.

[TranslatorEvent4]
Message=How can I get over these stone doors? I heard from a Mercenary, they can be opened with a lever, that is hidden in a Pyramid.

[TranslatorEvent5]
Message=My Log: I'm starting to feel a bit tired. I'll find a nice spot somewhere to sleep.

[TranslatorEvent6]
Message=My Log: I'll rest here for a while. It's not the Hilton, but it will be good enough.

[TranslatorEvent7]
Message=My Log: This is a quite puzzling underground. I have no idea where I am.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent8]
Message=My Log: I just don't like this place. I have a feeling, that somewhere nearby are infernal demons.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent9]
Message=My Log: This part of the underground is somehow cold? I just don't understand it. How do they change the temperature and put winter here?

[TranslatorEvent10]
Message=Of the 10, who read these lines, none will ever see the light of day again. That sounds ominous.

[TranslatorEvent11]
Message=My Log: Ooof! Fortunately there was water. Great, I'm out of the cold, but now I have to find a way back up.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent12]
Message=My Log: What is this tunnel? Why is it so big? Who created it? Where leads it to? I only know one way to find out.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent13]
Message=My Log: It appears these gates haven't moved in a very long time. Better look another way.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent14]
Message=I fell into this tunnel. I'm afraid of what may await me here. It is said, that this tunnel labyrinth spreads under the whole planet and leads to hell or elsewhere.

[TranslatorEvent16]
Message=My Log: What is this abhorrent place of torment? Lots of blood, guts and meat. It makes me sick!
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent18]
Message=My Log: This is probably a Mercenary meeting hall.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent19]
Message=Lately strange things occur. Sirius began to fill with demons. We suffered heavy losses in fighting the Skaarj and a stranger arrived. We hide for a time in the Mayan cities in the Northeast, until the situation calms down.

[TranslatorEvent22]
Message=My Log: Damn, this is a big maze. I can not get out of here, I feel like I walk around forever with demons of hell everywhere.
