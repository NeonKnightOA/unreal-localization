[TranslatorEvent1]
Message=My Log: Closed. For now even the best will not be able to pass through the door.
M_NewMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent2]
Message=My Log: What a tremendous void, it's so far to the bottom of this shaft.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent3]
Message=My Log: This passageway appears to be suitable for use.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent4]
Message=My Log: So finally I'm in the town and somewhat safer, especially in this intricate system of halls. Looking at the posters of big brother makes the people feel, they are being monitored.

[TranslatorEvent5]
Message=My Log: The apartments are modestly furnished. Old rickety bunks and a small table with chairs. They have just one room. Some also have a small kitchenette for the convenience of residents.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent6]
Message=My Log: The corridors are dimly lit. Is no one doing maintenance? Some are lit and some not.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent7]
Message=My Log: This door is locked. It makes no sense to go through all the apartments, I'll just run into someone. Violence between people is very common, so it is better to be quiet.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent8]
Message=My Log: No sense trying the lift. Even in the best times, it seldom worked and presently the electric is cut off during the day, as part of austerity measures.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent9]
Message=My Log: This place looks familiar. If I'm not mistaken, my apartment is just two floors up.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent10]
Message=My Log: This screen both sends and receives. Every sound is captured. They can see me too. One is never sure at any moment, if the Thought Police is watching. It's assumed to be constant. They can turn it on, if they want to.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent11]
Message=My Log: For some reason, the screen is in an unusual position. Normally it's on the front wall, where it scans the whole room towards the window. This niche with the bookshelf lies outside the view of the screen.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent12]
Message=My Log: It's better to turn the back on them, while they watch. But even a back can reveal secret thoughts.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent13]
Message=My Log: So I'm finally home after so much time and I still will not have peace.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent14]
Message=My Log: There are rumors, some sort of brotherhood is fighting against the government. The problem is, to find the way to them. They are our only hope. Great, the Thought Police will be here in no time now.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent15]
Message=My Log: Kramek's consumer goods. As usual, the shelves are almost empty. Even shoelaces and razor blades are impossible to get for months now.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent16]
Message=My Log: What's this? A secret room or passage? In this huge city, many people could use such secrets.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent17]
Message=My Log: Store's secret sale place. Wow, CD's with metal music and pictures. If the Thought Police knew... This is only for a few customers. Getting CD's is impossible now. I am amazed, that these were made, when the material was hard to get.

[TranslatorEvent18]
Message=My Log: Cinemas play the same war movies like a refugee ship being bombed. The audience loved it, when humans fled a helicopter chasing them. It was seen thru a gun sight. People were shot bloody, then they died. The audience roared with laughter.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent19]
Message=My Log: Then there was a lifeboat full of children and above it a helicopter. It dropped a bomb. Terrific flash, boat exploded to splinters and a child's hand flew high in the air. From the party members came a huge applause.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent20]
Message=My Log: Stairs to other floors collapsed long ago, due to insufficient maintenance. The stairs in the hotel are required, so they are kept in good condition.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent21]
Message=My Log: Standard toilets. No one has a privacy partition, because it's a 'luxury'. Small video screens are also on the toilet.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent22]
Message=My Log: This looks like a good escape. The sewers spread all over, even when the main gate is closed.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent23]
Message=My Log: In the cellars screens are in the hallways and in some rooms. Mostly there are only microphones. So if you are quiet, you can do what you want.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent24]
Message=My Log: Local cafe. People come here to play chess or just chat over a glass of gin.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent25]
Message=My Log: Hotel room with a modified screen? The unit has a tape, that plays over and over again. So they still see an empty room. I heard about this, it's a secret entrance to the old section.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent27]
Message=My Log: A sensor automatically closes this. Even if someone finds the false door in the closet, he only sees a wall.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent28]
Message=My Log: This cable shaft could get me into the old section.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent29]
Message=My Log: We formed a resistance gang and finally managed, to get a gun and a decoder. Now we can break the security codes for doors. In a hotel room is a secret closet. It's a great shortcut to the old section and the 'Brotherhood'.
