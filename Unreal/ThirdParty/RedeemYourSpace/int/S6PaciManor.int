Message=My Log: Where did they put the bar stools? Aha, they are on the ceiling. At least it is original.

Message=My Log: Inside are tables with chairs. A Czech teacher commented on this: That's how I imagine it. There's a pile of tables and chairs.

Message=My Log: I can see this in a newspaper headline: He drowned in the bath, which was upside down on the ceiling. A ton of water mysteriously stuck there.

Message=My Log: This house seems to be much bigger, than I expected.

[TranslatorEvent7]
Message=My Log: Very interesting house. Some rooms are upside down. In other rooms, the wall is the floor or the ceiling is the wall. As I go through the rooms, I get confused. Right now I find, that suddenly the ground floor is now the wall...

[TranslatorEvent8]
Message=My Log: The house looks abandoned. I'll look for someone, who can tell me, where it actually came from.

[TranslatorEvent9]
Message=My Log: This is a psycho house! Rooms lose their shape, doors are various contortions... But most of it is original. I was embarrassed to have you just go through the normal manor house.

[TranslatorEvent10]
Message=My Log: Interesting solution to a corridor.

[TranslatorEvent13]
Message=My Log: Hmm. Chimney leading back into the house. That's certainly not ideal :-)

[TranslatorEvent14]
Message=12 May 2084: My big house is almost done, missing only a few rooms. 14 May 2084: During the night, the house began making strange noises. I have a feeling, that demons are in the house.

Message=7 May 2084: The house is almost done. Finally I can still explore this mysterious puzzle. Paci knows about it. 13 May 2084: I finally figured it out, how to open the Lament Configuration.

Message=15 May 2084: Today I moved into the house. After so long, I can now listen to metal. 17 May 2084: What's going on? Harold and Tom mysteriously disappeared. I lost the house keys and saw some things, but I don't know what. Red ghosts...

Message=8 May 2084: Paci's crazyhouse is built. Rooms of various state. Bar stools on the ceiling. The chimney of the fireplace back in the house. Weird space dimension. Cellar with trees. At least it's untraditional.
