Message="My Log: It's awfully hot. It seems this planet is of volcanic origin, but you can see that someone is living there. The city is remarkably similar to the old gangster-cities of the 20th century. I must be careful of the local residents and Kralls too."

[TranslatorEvent11]
Message="My Log: Classical constables stock. Nowadays it's rare. In the store I'll find some good equipment. Since this is an enormous base of two hostile races, I don't even know what I'm dealing with. I need to find some guns."
