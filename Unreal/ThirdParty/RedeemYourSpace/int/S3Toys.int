Message=My Log: This reminds me of my childhood dice. Each side can put together a picture. But we were not punks then.

Message=My Log: In these crates are cubes for children. These are really interesting pictures. We find a lot of punks, some things about a Stargate, metalheads and even there is Paci:-).

Message=My Log: I see that here by the door WTC is built, but it's not possible since it was more than 280 years ago. And how would they know on Haros about it? What if I'm not on Haros ??? And is that even real ???
