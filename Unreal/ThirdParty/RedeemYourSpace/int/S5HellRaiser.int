Message="Pinhead: Ahh Joseph, we thought we'd lost you."

[SpecialEvent63]
Message="Pinhead: How nice of you to return."

[SpecialEvent64]
Message="Pinhead: Joseph - so magnanimous, you do not want to be late. So naive of you, that you will not admit it."

[SpecialEvent65]
Message="Pinhead: And perhaps are you playing with us? Are you making fun of us?"

[SpecialEvent66]
Message="Joseph: NOOOOOOO!"

[SpecialEvent67]

[SpecialEvent76]
Message="Joseph: Go away and leave me alone!"

[SpecialEvent77]
Message="Pinhead: Oh, no tears, please."

[SpecialEvent78]
Message="Pinhead: It's a waste of good suffering."

[SpecialEvent79]
Message="Joseph: Have you no mercy?"

[SpecialEvent80]
Message="Pinhead: People like you are just so happy for anguish."

[SpecialEvent81]
Message="Pinhead: Especially, if it is the suffering of others."

[SpecialEvent82]
Message="Pinhead: Now is the time for a taste. A taste of your own suffering, hatred and pain."

[SpecialEvent83]
Message="Pinhead: Just look at all the worlds which are enslaved."

[SpecialEvent84]
Message="Pinhead: Just look at the state of the planet Earth..."
