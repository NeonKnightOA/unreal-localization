[SpecialEvent7]

[SpecialEvent8]
Message=Nali: ... belongs to you.

[SpecialEvent11]
Message=Joseph: I do not understand.

[SpecialEvent12]
Message=Nali: I know.

[SpecialEvent13]
Message=Nali: So how did you not understand, when I told you to go home.

[SpecialEvent14]
Message=Nali: I did not mean this house.

[SpecialEvent15]
Message=Nali: I was referring to your first home.

[SpecialEvent16]
Message=Nali: The one in which you grew up.

[SpecialEvent17]
Message=Nali: I can help you... understand.

[SpecialEvent18]
Message=Nali: I know everything about you, Joseph.

[SpecialEvent19]
Message=Nali: Your case is almost closed.

[SpecialEvent20]
Message=Joseph: I'm not a murderer!

[SpecialEvent21]
Message=Nali: So you found him, now you have to go back to where you started.

[SpecialEvent22]
Message=Nali: Come back, Joseph. Come home.

[SpecialEvent24]
Message=Mom: I made you a pie, your favorite.

[SpecialEvent25]
Message=Mom: Do you know, why I baked it?

[SpecialEvent27]
Message=Mom: I'll give a little to dad.

[SpecialEvent28]
Message=Joseph: Mom?

[SpecialEvent29]
Message=Mom: Joe, why did you stop by?

[SpecialEvent30]
Message=Mom: I still work for the Air Force.

[SpecialEvent31]

[SpecialEvent32]
Message=Pinhead: Everything is just a riddle.

[SpecialEvent33]
Message=Nali: Welcome home, Joseph.

[SpecialEvent34]
Message=Nali: It's been nearly an hour.

[SpecialEvent35]
Message=Nali: Nobody was there, when I arrived. No one, who would hear them crying.

[SpecialEvent36]
Message=Nali: Did Tony.

[SpecialEvent37]
Message=Nali: A child's finger in his mouth.

[SpecialEvent38]
Message=Nali: Time for the stomach, since the finger was not burned.

[SpecialEvent39]
Message=Nali: Look at the fingerprint and miraculously find out, to whom it belongs.

[SpecialEvent40]
Message=What they found, does not make any sense ...

[SpecialEvent41]
Message=Pinhead: I like to play chess.

[SpecialEvent42]
Message=Pinhead: Figures are moving across the surface with one simple intention.

[SpecialEvent43]
Message=Pinhead ... kill the king.

[SpecialEvent44]
Message=Joseph: Who is the king in this game?

[SpecialEvent45]
Message=Pinhead: That question, you have to answer yourself.

[SpecialEvent46]
Message=Pinhead: Do not you recognize your own body? Own spirit?

[SpecialEvent47]
Message=Joseph: I do not understand.

[SpecialEvent48]
Message=Pinhead: Internal effort to preserve your own humanity.

[SpecialEvent49]
Message=Pinhead: Intolerance, whimper for help. 'Please help me'...

[SpecialEvent50]
Message=Pinhead: This is the life you chose, Joseph.

[SpecialEvent51]
Message=Pinhead: All those people, whom you hurt. All your desires, that you have satisfied.

[SpecialEvent52]
Message=Pinhead: You ruined your own innocence.

[SpecialEvent53]
Message=Pinhead: You let your body betray your spirit.

[SpecialEvent54]
Message=Pinhead: You are its own... king.

[SpecialEvent55]
Message=Pinhead: And this is a Hell, which you have created for yourself.

[SpecialEvent56]
Message=Pinhead: Your body kills it's own spirit.

[SpecialEvent57]
Message=Joseph: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!

[SpecialEvent58]
Message=Pinhead: Oh yes, Joseph. Oh yes.

[SpecialEvent59]
Message=Pinhead: The next death remains to be finished.

[SpecialEvent60]
Message=Pinhead: Welcome to the worst nightmare of all ... reality!

[SpecialEvent62]
Message=Pinhead: Ahh Joseph, we thought we'd lost you

[SpecialEvent63]
Message=Pinhead: How nice of you, that you have returned.

[SpecialEvent64]
Message=Pinhead: Joseph - so magnanimous, you do not want to be late. So naive of you, that you will not admit it.

[SpecialEvent65]
Message=Pinhead: And perhaps you are playing with us? You're making fun of us?

[SpecialEvent66]
Message=Joseph: NOOOOOOO!

[SpecialEvent67]
Message=Pinhead: HA HA HA HA HA.

[SpecialEvent68]
Message=Pinhead: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

[SpecialEvent69]
Message=You feel yourself leaving your own body...

[SpecialEvent70]
Message=Your mind, it floats up from your body.

[SpecialEvent71]
Message=Your mind now can know the truth.

[SpecialEvent72]
Message=Now it is moved into the consciousness of Joseph.

[SpecialEvent73]
Message=You know now the crimes and suffering...

[SpecialEvent74]
Message=Pinhead: We are here. Now you must come with us.

[SpecialEvent75]
Message=Pinhead: It will be our pleasure to have you.

[SpecialEvent76]
Message=Joseph: Go away and leave me alone!

[SpecialEvent77]
Message=Pinhead: Oh, no tears, please.

[SpecialEvent78]
Message=Pinhead: It's a waste of good suffering.

[SpecialEvent79]
Message=Joseph: Have you no mercy?

[SpecialEvent80]
Message=Pinhead: People like you are just so happy for anguish.

[SpecialEvent81]
Message=Pinhead: Especially, if it is the suffering of others.

[SpecialEvent82]
Message=Pinhead: Now is the time for a taste. A taste of your own suffering, hatred and pain.

[SpecialEvent83]
Message=Pinhead: Just look at all the worlds, who are enslaved.

[SpecialEvent84]
Message=Pinhead: Just look at the state of the planet Earth ...

[SpecialEvent85]
Message=Pinhead: A world full of suffering, hatred, evil.

[SpecialEvent86]
Message=Joseph: I did not know, this would happen in the future.

[SpecialEvent87]
Message=Pinhead: You knew too well, what was going to happen.

[SpecialEvent88]
Message=Pinhead: Your time is coming to an end.

[SpecialEvent89]
Message=Pinhead: I'll rip your soul apart. HA HA HA HA HA.

[SpecialEvent90]
Message=Welcome to your own hell.

[SpecialEvent91]
Message=Pinhead: I'm tired of wasting time.

[SpecialEvent92]
Message=Pinhead: Welcome to hell.

[SpecialEvent93]
Message=Pinhead: You are a fighter... Do you see now, who is behind the state of the universe? Now continue your journey.
