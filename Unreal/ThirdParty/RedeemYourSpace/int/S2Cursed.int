Message=My Log: It looks like an old abandoned subway station. And it seems, that it's a place of street loafers, who populate the dark forces. Wait until they find out, what will happen to them.

Message=My Log: Getting to the surface is blocked by the wall, not a way out. Perhaps I can find another way. Dark forces are too powerful here, I must eradicate them.
