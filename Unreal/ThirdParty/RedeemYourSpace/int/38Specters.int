Title=Shinigami - Burial Underground

[SpecialEvent8]
Message=Drink and be refreshed.

[SpecialEvent9]
Message=When the spirit is vigilant, the body thrives.

[SpecialEvent10]
Message=The way is made clear, when viewed from above.

[SpecialEvent11]
Message=Strength is bolstered by heavenly faith.

[SpecialEvent12]
Message=Me: Where did you come from all of a sudden?

[SpecialEvent13]
Message=Nali: We come from a planet, that you helped to liberate.

[SpecialEvent14]
Message=Me: How does it look now, in the universe I mean?

[SpecialEvent15]
Message=Nali: After you killed the leader, we managed with the help of friends from Exploited to destroy the remnants of the enemy.

[SpecialEvent16]
Message=Me: Well I had no idea, that things are moving so fast.

[SpecialEvent17]
Message=Me: I need any information about the device on Soulstone. I need it to destroy the iris.

[SpecialEvent18]
Message=Nali: I know little about the device, but a short walk from the gate is a hidden computer, where perhaps is the information you seek.

[SpecialEvent19]
Message=Nali: But watch out, the planet is full of Titans. Once upon a time giants lived there, but one day they were apparently decimated. No one knows for sure.

[SpecialEvent20]
Message=Nali: Why destroy the iris? Perhaps you do not want to go to Tauri?

[SpecialEvent21]
Message=Me: I came from the planet, but I had no idea Skaarj were allies on Tauri. I'll have to find out, what's going on.

[SpecialEvent22]
Message=Nali: The local branch of the rebels recently tried to establish contact with us, but results were disappointing.

[SpecialEvent23]
Message=Nali: When you get there, try to find out, what's going on. If there are Skaarj allies, they could help Tauri rebels.

[SpecialEvent24]
Message=Me: It seems, that I will have to eventually fight my own government. It is true of ordinary people, that enough persecution makes them rise against the government.

[SpecialEvent25]
Message=Me: See you later. Once your world is free, I'm going to Soulstone.

[TranslatorEvent1]
Message=My Log: Behind this door, I can hear the sounds of demons. Again, I have a strange feeling of fear. Don't open this.

[TranslatorEvent2]
Message=My Log: Apparently I got into some forgotten sewer. It's not a friendly place, it's dark and cold. Who knows, what other horrors are hiding there.

[TranslatorEvent3]
Message=My Log: Spirit voices are heard everywhere. You better get out as quickly as possible.

Message=My Log: At last I got out of those dark sewers.

[TranslatorEvent5]
Message=My Log: The Shaft is leading to the surface. It is not possible to get out that way.
M_NewMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent6]
Message=My Log: I think I'm in a dungeon.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent7]
Message=My Log: I have been underground for a long time. My sense of direction is good, though so I think I'm near the gate.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent8]
Message=My Log: Another of the many tombs. It is unreal how many people lived underground on all the planets. It seems a tomb serves as a warning of the dark forces.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent9]
Message=My Log: Finally I'm out of those dark tombs and crypts full of the undead. I hope it was the last of my trips to such places.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent10]
Message=My Log: So I finally got back to the gate.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent11]
Message=My Log: Going home would be suicide, now I go by what I read in books in the castle. I look at this mysterious planet Soulstone, fearing what is there. It is said, no one ever came back.
