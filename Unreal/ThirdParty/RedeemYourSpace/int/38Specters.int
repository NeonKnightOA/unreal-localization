Title="Shinigami - Burial Underground"

[SpecialEvent8]
Message="Drink and be refreshed."

[SpecialEvent9]
Message="When the spirit is vigilant, the body thrives."

[SpecialEvent10]
Message="The way is made clear when viewed from above."

[SpecialEvent11]
Message="Strength is bolstered by heavenly faith."

[SpecialEvent12]
Message="Me: Where did you come from all of a sudden?"

[SpecialEvent13]
Message="Nali: We come from a planet that you helped to liberate."

[SpecialEvent14]
Message="Me: How does it look now? In the universe, I mean..."

[SpecialEvent15]
Message="Nali: After you killed their leader, we managed to destroy the remnants of the enemy army with the help of friends from Exploited."

[SpecialEvent16]
Message="Me: Well, I had no idea that things were moving so fast."

[SpecialEvent17]
Message="Me: I need any information about the device on Soulstone. I need it to destroy the Iris."

[SpecialEvent18]
Message="Nali: I know little about the device, however, there is a hidden computer a short distance from the gate where, perhaps, the information you seek may be."

[SpecialEvent19]
Message="Nali: Watch out, however, as the planet is full of Titans. Once upon a time, Giants lived there but, one day, they were apparently decimated. No one knows for sure."

[SpecialEvent20]
Message="Nali: Why destroy the Iris? Perhaps you do not want to go to Tauri?"

[SpecialEvent21]
Message="Me: I came from the planet, but I had no idea the Skaarj were allies on Tauri. I'll have to find out, what's going on."

[SpecialEvent22]
Message="Nali: The local branch of the rebels recently tried to establish contact with us, but results were disappointing."

[SpecialEvent23]
Message="Nali: Once you get there, try to find out what's going on. If there are Skaarj allies, they could help Tauri rebels."

[SpecialEvent24]
Message="Me: It seems that I will have to eventually fight my own government. It is true that enough persecution against ordinary people makes them rise against the government."

[SpecialEvent25]
Message="Me: See you later. Once your world is free, I'm going to Soulstone."

[TranslatorEvent1]

[TranslatorEvent8]
Message="My Log: Another of the many tombs. It is unreal how many people lived underground on all the planets. It seems a tomb serves as a warning of the dark forces."

[TranslatorEvent9]
Message="My Log: Finally I'm out of those dark tombs and crypts full of the undead. I hope it was the last of my trips to such places."

[TranslatorEvent11]
Message="My Log: Going home would be suicide, now I go by what I read in books in the castle. I look at this mysterious planet Soulstone, fearing what is there. It is said, no one ever came back."
