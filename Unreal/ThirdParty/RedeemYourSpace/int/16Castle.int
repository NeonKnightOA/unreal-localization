Message=My Log: I must find the Krall leader. If I kill him, then the Krall will begin to die out. Haros could then be a Nali resettlement. I expect a lot of elite Krall ahead.

Message=My Log: Castle Gallery. Krall put stolen paintings from different planets here. I can see some from Madehiten and other planets. Some are unique on Haros I think.

Message=My Log: Phew I made it. The defeat of the leader will make Kralls die out. Those around them are still in danger though. I found a few books on the processing of titanium, so the danger is not over yet.
