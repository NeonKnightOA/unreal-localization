Title=Haros - Ice Morning

[TranslatorEvent0]
Message=My Log: That was a good sleep. Brr...but it's surely winter. Outside it's snowing heavily. I'm struck by how cold it is. I should find a fireplace to warm up.

Message=My Log: Finally some heat. I need to find the Stargate. Is it far away? Outside will be around -30° Celsius and I have few warm clothes. A hard way awaits me.

[TranslatorEvent2]
Message=My Log: Whoa, more snow than I thought. Well it will be interesting to wade through almost two meters of snow.

[TranslatorEvent3]
Message=My Log: Door does not open, frozen. Things don't go well for me.
M_NewMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent4]
Message=My Log: I see that someone forgot to close the door last evening. Looks like I won't go this way. I'll have to find another exit to get to the gate.

[TranslatorEvent5]
Message=My Log: I see more snow on the roof. I never experienced something like that before. On Earth it rarely snows. My ancestors told me of snowstorms, but I never saw any.

[TranslatorEvent6]
Message=My Log: Roof obviously did not last under the snow pressure and crashed. It occurs to me, that I could get to the gate underground.

[TranslatorEvent7]
Message=My Log: Here are even winter and ice in the sewer.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent8]
Message=My Log: This aren't good news. The Sewage system is frozen.

[TranslatorEvent9]
Message=My Log: It's too slippery.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent10]
Message=My Log: Brrr...colder than I ever experienced before. Well at least the snow had stopped.

[TranslatorEvent12]
Message=My Log: Finally here at the gate. Quickly, enter the location of Sirius. Let's get out or freeze to death.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent13]
Message=My Log: I see the Gateway. Village at the gate is buried by 3 meter layer of snow. How they survive here, I don't know.

[TranslatorEvent14]
Message=One of us managed to remember the address of the planet of our allies the Brutes. The last of us Kralls managed to dig a snow path to the gate.

[TranslatorEvent15]
Message=My Log: Where leads this way to? Looks like the Krall wanted to leave Haros. Perhaps this path leads to the gate.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent16]
Message=My Log: So I'm at the edge of town, now just find a way to get to the gate. Snow plows have not gotten around yet and digging it myself would take a year.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent17]
Message=My Log: Ah, a fire...I needed that. I'll take a moment the warm up and then head to the gate.

[TranslatorEvent18]
Message=This book is about the afterlife. Every good man after death rises on the level of his deeds, while the villains and evil people will be condemned to hell.
