Message="My Log: That was a good sleep. Brr... but it's surely winter. Outside it's snowing heavily. I'm struck by how cold it is. I should find a fireplace to warm up."

Message="My Log: Finally some heat. I need to find the Stargate. Is it far away? Outside will be around -30° Celsius and I have few warm clothes. A hard way awaits me."

[TranslatorEvent4]
Message="My Log: I see that someone forgot to close the door last evening. Looks like I won't go this way. I'll have to find another exit to get to the gate."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent5]
Message="My Log: I see more snow on the roof. I never experienced something like that before. On Earth, it rarely snows. My ancestors told me of snowstorms, but I never saw any."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent6]
Message="My Log: Roof obviously did not last under the snow pressure and crashed. It occurs to me that I could get to the gate underground."

M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent16]
Message="My Log: So I'm at the edge of town, now I just have to find a way to get to the gate. Snow plows have not gotten around yet and digging it myself would take a year."
