Message=My Log: Finally got to the outskirts. Castle isn't far away, but Krall won't just let someone go into the castle. I'll have to find a safer way.

Message=My Log: Public gallows. In the old books I read about it sometimes. Perhaps it was best to deter another killer from his actions. It is said, that the growing prison system was one reason for the collapse of our civilization.

Message=Krall at night close all the city gates, because of enemies and demons. Most gates open downtown, often a lever is hidden nearby. I think that one is opposite to the abandoned library.
M_NewMessage=Krall notes

[TranslatorEvent5]
Message=The library is long closed and locked from the inside. Once upon a time, we climbed through a cupboard to get in.

[TranslatorEvent6]
Message=We got the message, that the gate was lost again. It appalled me to find out. For sure we have strengthened the guard at the castle. Our leader does not wish to be disturbed.

[TranslatorEvent8]
Message=My Log: It is obvious, that the library hasn't seen use in years. Nothing but quiet and dusty books.

Message=My Log: I should watch out for any surprises I find.
M_NewMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent11]
Message=My Log: This is probably the way to the castle. The gate is closed, so it is best to find some secret way, that will not be too much guarded.

[TranslatorEvent12]
Message=My Log: Why is this door suspiciously open? Aha, some joker put an anvil on the door! Glad I noticed it, otherwise it would have landed on my damn head.

[TranslatorEvent14]
Message=My Log: Here it is. Now I can find a way into the castle. Is it possible, that I will find hellish demons? Haros is full of them.

[TranslatorEvent17]
Message=My Log: This is one of those places, where they locked up prisoners awaiting execution.
