Message="I just don't know if I can use this lift."

[SpecialEvent1]
Message="A is the express lift."

[SpecialEvent2]
Message="A is coming."

[SpecialEvent3]
Message="I think the steps are the better choice."

[SpecialEvent4]
Message="Me: I finally found you. It was not easy to get here."

[SpecialEvent5]
Message="Fraternity member: Good that you killed the demons in the station."

[SpecialEvent6]
Message="Fraternity member: I killed some of them too, but there are always more."

[SpecialEvent7]
Message="Me: Where did they come from? I've already met them many times."

[SpecialEvent8]
Message="Fraternity member: It is said they are cursed souls of creatures or bad people."

[SpecialEvent9]
Message="Me: There is something about them. I visited many planets and wherever tyranny ruled, there were the demons."

[SpecialEvent10]
Message="Me: Where can I find your leader?"

[SpecialEvent11]
Message="Fraternity member: Housed in an old metro station. You cannot miss it."

[SpecialEvent12]
Message="Me: Thanks!"

[SpecialEvent13]
Message="Brotherhood member: We are planning to attack the inner sector of the government."

[SpecialEvent14]
Message="Fraternity member: Inside is a weapon. If you need the ammo, take it too."

[SpecialEvent15]
Message="Me: Super, I need it. My last clashes with the soldiers have taken almost everything."

[SpecialEvent17]
Message="So I'm here. You can go."

[SpecialEvent18]
Message="Fraternity member: Good. That's the plan."

[SpecialEvent19]
Message="Fraternity member: You take care of the defense ministry center and the defense systems will fall."

[SpecialEvent20]
Message="Fraternity member: Paci and your group, you attack the laboratory and collect all records and new technology."

[SpecialEvent21]
Message="Fraternity member: You get the inner section and various channels, cellars and tunnels."

[SpecialEvent22]
Message="Brotherhood member: We will operate separately. Attack the central control system as soon as possible, removing the inner section from power."

[SpecialEvent23]
Message="Fraternity member: Eventually, we all meet in the administrative center."

[SpecialEvent24]
Message="Fraternity member: After the destruction of the tracking systems, we will be able to contact each other and organize again."

[SpecialEvent25]
Message="Paci: I welcome you here."

[SpecialEvent26]
Message="Me: It looks like you are preparing for a fight."

[SpecialEvent27]
Message="Me: Heya. It was hard to get here."

[SpecialEvent28]
Message="Paci: We're going on a little raid of the inner section to steal and destroy."

[SpecialEvent29]
Message="Paci: Our government used to create different races? I've heard of people struggling against some of those races."

[SpecialEvent30]
Message="Me: Yes! And I even won the support of the population and liberated people from them."

[SpecialEvent31]
Message="Me: Yet some of the races have turned against the people and plundered another planet."

[SpecialEvent32]
Message="Me: They even have some ships. We need to destroy them to protect Earth."

[SpecialEvent33]
Message="Paci: This is one of the few places the government does not know about."

[SpecialEvent34]
Message="Me: I have been on several other planets. I managed to destroy the enemy races."

[SpecialEvent35]
Message="Paci: I have lived elsewhere, but we were discovered."

[SpecialEvent36]
Message="Me: I heard they were created by our government."

[SpecialEvent37]
Message="Me: Even today the government produces the Skaarj race in order to again obtain power over the planet and eventually the universe."

[SpecialEvent38]
Message="Paci: This will help a lot. How did you actually get to Earth?"

[SpecialEvent39]
Message="Paci: And how you have destroyed some of the races?"

[SpecialEvent40]
Message="Me: A StarGate. The government has it in the big concrete building in section 16."

[SpecialEvent41]
Message="Paci: They have a StarGate?! It is kept very secret. We don't know about it at all."

[SpecialEvent42]
Message="Me: So it seems."

[SpecialEvent43]
Message="Me: It's very well guarded, plenty of soldiers. I just managed to escape."

[SpecialEvent44]
Message="Me: I see you have enough music here. Where did you get it?"

[SpecialEvent45]
Message="Paci: The group with the CDs often change their residence... I cannot say."

[SpecialEvent46]
Message="Paci: So we go. See Nako for ammunition, if you need it."

[SpecialEvent48]
Message="Paci: A team will go through the door on the top tube station. Once there, we are going to continue the offensive."

[SpecialEvent49]
Message="Paci: One special group is somewhere in a secret underground production facility and makes CDs of old bands."

[SpecialEvent50]
Message="Paci: Sometimes they drop them off to us, but I have no idea where they are situated."
