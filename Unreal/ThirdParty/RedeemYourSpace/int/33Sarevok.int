Message=My Log: So I finally got to the planet. Now I need to find out, where the Skaarj queen is and what they are up to. From what I know, the Skaarj plan to occupy Sirius. It's currently cleared and I don't want to go back there.

Message=My Log: Hm ... locked, so it seems this should be the main entrance. I'll have to find another way out of the village.

Message=5 days ago someone took a Stargate to here. The main entrance is closed, but the intruder found a secret passage thru the dark forest and into the city Amarok. Local guards should be informed, because Amarok is our capital.

Message=From Research: Stonehenge likely serves to concentrate cosmic energy to be used for great things. This energy can be incredibly powerful. It serves as a protection against the enemies, coming through the Stargate.

Message=This book shows planet locations: Madehiten, Haros, Chicken Itza, Pharao. Those I know, but there are 2 others I don't. Soulstone and Tauri. I also didn't know of a Stargate on Earth, but it is said, that our government keeps it. Why?

Message=My Log: This is the edge of Sarevok village. I went through it all and there's nowhere to go now. I'll try a better search, maybe I can find some secret passage.
