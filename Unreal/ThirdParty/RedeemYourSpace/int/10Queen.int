Title=Exploited - Way of the Salvation

[SpecialEvent10]
Message=Population: Thanks for helping us with the Kralls and Skaarj.

[SpecialEvent11]
Message=Me: It was nothing. I was looking for the queen here.

[SpecialEvent12]
Message=Population: What? They have a queen here!?

[SpecialEvent13]
Message=Me: I was surprised too, when I learned it from the base computer.

[SpecialEvent14]
Message=Population: If you kill her, where will you go then?

[SpecialEvent15]
Message=Me: To Haros, Krall's home planet and I already killed her.

[SpecialEvent16]
Message=Population: Well we will clean up the remaining enemies left behind, now after you eliminated her. Good luck friend!

[SpecialEvent17]
Message=Me: Oh, Here's the location of Madehiten. Please go help the Nali. See you later.

[TranslatorEvent0]
Message=My Log: There was an explosion. The whole base is completely destroyed along with the Skaarj and pupae. Now I must still find the queen and dispatch her.

[TranslatorEvent1]
Message=My Log: An old underground dungeon. Probably from the time, when the Nali lived here. Perhaps I will learn more.

[TranslatorEvent2]
Message=My Log: This corridor looks important. This door here is insulated from the cold. Probably upgraded over the years to avoid any draft.

[TranslatorEvent3]
Message=My Log: Underground harbor. This ship will take me further. Hopefully it leads me to the queen.

[TranslatorEvent4]
Message=The situation is desperate. Taros has many meteorites in orbit. Using the Stargate is risky, but I have to try. My only hope to get to the ancient palace, is through this canyon.

[TranslatorEvent5]
Message=My Log: This aqueduct looks like it was once on the surface. It was probably asteroid impact that changed things.

[TranslatorEvent6]
Message=Taros endures bad times. In the 18th century a meteor crash destroyed life here. At the end of 21 century, Nali will come here and renew life.

[TranslatorEvent7]
Message=A full week of asteroid impacts. Surface cities destroyed. Most of us saved, they managed to get to the Stargate on time. We may be protected, but under the mountain we will run out of food.

Message=My Log: This gorge is still alive.

Message=My Log: Main temple. The Skaarj Queen will be close now. This planet will see a great day of liberation.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent10]
Message=My Log: So that's it. The Skaarj Queen is dead. Skaarj days on this planet are numbered and the alliance between Skaarj and Kralls is definitely in trouble.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent11]
Message=My Log: Now I just need to get to the gate. Perhaps I can tell someone on the surface about the Queen.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent12]
Message=My Log: So I have 2 locations of other planets: Haros and Sirius. Sirius is full of Skaarj. It will not be wise to go there, since they are still strong.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent13]
Message=My Log: Haros, Krall planet. Perhaps if I can cause heavy losses. Then they would be prey for other races and gradually disappear. Skaarj and Mercenary don't pose a big threat.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent14]
Message=My Log: Wow this is the warehouse at the gate! At least I will not have to wander around all day and look.
M_NewMessage=My Log
M_TransMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent15]
Message=My Log: I Enter Haros location and get ready to go. I wonder what the planet looks like. I hope it will not be as hot as Exploited, that was unbearable.
