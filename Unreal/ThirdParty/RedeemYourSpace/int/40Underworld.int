Message="My Log: It was a trap. I fell into some tunnel. Well, at least I know how to disable the Iris. But first, I have to get out of here and get to Stonehenge. Hmm... what's that red light over there?"

Message="My Log: What is this? Blood drips from the ceiling from a piece of meat, pretty disgusting. It is certainly a work of hellish demons. I'm getting used to this from what I've seen on all these planets, but I know almost nothing about them."

Message="My Log: I wonder who built these tunnels. Why are they so terribly large? It obviously wasn't for people, maybe for giants?"

Message="My Log: Underground tunnels will be around the entire planet. I better think of how to get topside."

Message="My Log: It smells rotten. These rooms were designed for the storage of meat. Perhaps human..."
