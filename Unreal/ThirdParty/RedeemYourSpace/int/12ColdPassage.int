[TranslatorEvent0]
Message="Hi! :-) This secret was added by Leo(T.C.K.) by request of Rarsonic once, as you can see this is the unfinished barrier area, now here I've got an enhanced Shield Belt for ya."

[TranslatorEvent1]
Message="Day 3 on Haros. We hid here, I don't know if there is food. In the books, there are lots of references to the vast network of catacombs. At night, I can hear scary sounds. The catacombs must be really terrible."
M_NewMessage="Krall notes"
M_TransMessage="Krall notes"

[TranslatorEvent2]
Message="My Log: I opened the entrance to the catacombs. It smelled musty and cold. From what I've read so far, they are extensive. Who knows what horror I'll find."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent3]
Message="There are two questions left on this exam. I'll try to answer them myself. Well, of course, I'm a moron. :-) But they have 92% right so far, so it's good."

[TranslatorEvent5]
Message="My Log: The cold air and smell of death comes From this well. Who knows what's down there in the darkness..."

[TranslatorEvent6]
Message="This was the royal counselor Arthandas, who fell after a long illness."

[TranslatorEvent7]
Message="My Log: Stairs to the basement it seems. I really don't want to go deeper into the dark catacombs. I have no idea what is waiting for me down there."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent8]
Message="We thought that this was our end, but luckily Duncan found the secret entrance to the catacombs. What we've found surpassed our worst dreams. Hell's demons were everywhere and our group is doomed, no hope left."

M_TransMessage="Krall notes"

[TranslatorEvent9]
Message="We are lost in the catacombs, who knows where to go. I got to here... and a crypt full of undead Skaarj. I wonder what caused all this... but I'll never find out... I'm dying."
M_NewMessage="Krall notes"
M_TransMessage="Krall notes"

[TranslatorEvent10]
Message="My Log: Looks like some kind of royal crypt, but I'd rather not open it. I could find someone infected."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent11]
Message="Much of the population of Haros is infected by some Black Plague and slowly dying."
M_NewMessage="Krall notes"
M_TransMessage="Krall notes"

[TranslatorEvent12]
Message="Infection came through a StarGate, but could have started on several planets. The whole universe is now seeing some black plague. We do not know who made it. We do not have a cure."
M_NewMessage="Krall notes"
M_TransMessage="Krall notes"

[TranslatorEvent13]
Message="My Log: 1) I read many books. 45 years ago the plague spread. A ''time of darkness'', which men don't speak about. A third world war broke out, and mankind almost died. Since then, a harsh dictatorship set foot on Earth. But it's hazy, I was very young."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent14]
Message="My Log: 2) In this book, there is a description of how the epidemic spread. Many races were affected, but humans appear to be immune to the plague. It says that the Earth StarGate has been used for 100 years, if not more."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent15]
Message="For years we did not know what the ring was. One day it activated, and people came here from another world. They said it was planet Earth."

[TranslatorEvent19]
Message="My Log: Underground library, perhaps there is some good information."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent20]
Message="My Log: The door won't open. Something is blocking from the other side. Perhaps the demons of hell were here a long time ago, and local residents barricaded the entrances to the underground."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent21]
Message="My Log: I found something interesting here. According to this book, the Skaarj attacked Haros 30 years ago. A plague infected the Skaarj, then forced them to leave. However some were cured and kept the form."
M_NewMessage="My Log"
M_TransMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent22]
Message="My Log: Slowly I'm getting used to the smell of death, but this passage is the strongest smell that I've come across."
M_NewMessage="My Log"

[TranslatorEvent23]
Message="My Log: Here ends the underground. The catacombs are extensive and most of the way is blocked. I hope I can find a secret entrance somewhere, or I will not return to the surface."
