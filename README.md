# Neon_Knight's OldUnreal Localization Project Repository

## About
This repository holds text localizations for _Unreal_ (for the OldUnreal patch for ver. 227), _Unreal Tournament_ (for the OldUnreal patch ver. 469) and _Unreal Tournament 2004_ (for the 3369 patch with both Bonus Packs as well as the XP Bonus Maps). Currently the localization project manages 15 languages: English (.int), German (.det), French (.frt), Spanish (.est), Italian (.itt), Russian (.rut), Polish (.plt), Portuguese (.ptt), Hungarian (.hut), Czech (.czt), Swedish (.set), Catalan (.ctt), Dutch (.nlt), Norwegian (.not) and Japanese (.jpt). **NOT ALL LANGUAGES ARE COMPLETE**, currently that honor befells to English (obviously), Spanish and Italian. The rest of the languages, on the other hand, vary, from requiring a lot of work or be created from scratch, to just requiring the new strings and UT strings to be translated. This is a long-time project, so expect incompletions. Help is welcome in any regard.

## Cool! So, how do I help?

New translators need to read [this](https://www.oldunreal.com/wiki/index.php?title=Localization) in order to get familiarized with how the localization system of the UE1 works.

1. First you need an account on Github, obviously
2. Fork this repo
3. Create a new branch and switch to it (use Github Desktop if you don't feel like messing around with commandline and you're on Windows)
4. Make your changes
5. Push your changes to your branch in your cloned repo
6. Create a pull request

That's the cleanest way to create your series of changes (it's NOT a good idea to edit directly in Master). It's recommended that every branch contains a few changes, otherwise it would be a pain to merge with the current changes.

## But what if I don't want to work in Github?

We've got you covered as well. Open an account in [the OldUnreal Wiki](https://www.oldunreal.com/wiki/). The project's main page is [here](https://www.oldunreal.com/wiki/index.php?title=Oldunreal_Localization_Project). If your account in the Wiki requires approval, tag me/write me a PM so I can approve it. If you cannot edit in the Wiki, check if your e-mail is validated in the Preferences menu once you've logged in.

Each language has a portal which comprises the general guidelines. All languages support both games and can easily support other games as well as other translations. [Here's the Spanish language portal](https://www.oldunreal.com/wiki/index.php?title=Spanish_.est), for example. We also have [a general guidelines page](https://www.oldunreal.com/wiki/index.php?title=Language_Guidelines), with tips on keeping consistency across the whole translation. Each of the languages also has a Guidelines page, a set of translated strings kept as a guide for consistency. These usually comprise stuff like the Public sections, common strings between both games, locales, weapon ammo and item names, difficulty levels, etc. The guidelines are NOT set in stone, and can be modified at anytime, provided a consensus is reached. [Here's the Spanish language example](https://www.oldunreal.com/wiki/index.php?title=Spanish_.est/Language_Guidelines) And finally, we have the individual pages/files themselves. The idea of the whole format is that we just copy and paste into a blank file, and we have the translation ready to go. Some pages have multiple sections because they are used in multiple games, they're separated into their Public headers, the general translation for all games, and then the separate lines per game.
