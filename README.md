# OldUnreal Localization Project Repository

## About
This repository holds text localizations for _Unreal_ (for the OldUnreal patch for ver. 227), _Unreal Tournament_ (for the OldUnreal patch ver. 469), _Unreal Tournament 2003_ (for the v2225 patch as well as the Epic and DE Bonus Packs), _Unreal Tournament 2004_ (for the 3369 patch with the ECE and Mega Bonus Packs as well as the XP Bonus Maps). Currently the localization project manages 15 languages: English (.int), German (.det), French (.frt), Spanish (.est), Italian (.itt), Russian (.rut), Polish (.plt), Portuguese (.ptt), Hungarian (.hut), Czech (.czt), Swedish (.set), Catalan (.ctt), Dutch (.nlt), Norwegian (.not) and Japanese (.jpt). Additionally, UT2004 handles Korean (.kot), Simplified Chinese (.smt) and Traditional Chinese (.tmt) as well.

**NOT ALL LANGUAGES ARE COMPLETE**, currently that honor befells to English (obviously), German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Polish (Unreal only), Portuguese (Unreal only), Catalan and Dutch. The rest of the languages, on the other hand, vary, from requiring a lot of work or be created from scratch, to just requiring the new strings and UT strings to be translated. This is a long-time project, so expect incomplete stuff. Help is welcome in any regard.

## Cool! So, how do I help?

New translators need to read [this](https://www.oldunreal.com/wiki/index.php?title=Localization) in order to get familiarized with how the localization system of the UE1 works.

1. First you need an account on Github, obviously
2. Fork this repo
3. Create a new branch and switch to it (use Github Desktop if you don't feel like messing around with commandline and you're on Windows)
4. Make your changes
5. Push your changes to your branch in your cloned repo
6. Create a pull request

That's the cleanest way to create your series of changes (it's NOT a good idea to edit directly in Master). It's recommended that every branch contains a few changes, otherwise it would be a pain to merge with the current changes.

## But what if I don't want to work in GitHub?

Sorry. After all the work we did, we're using GitHub exclusively. We used to work in the Wiki, but the bulk of the activity took place here, and, honestly, keeping the localization files in the repo is easier said and done here than in the Wiki, where we don't have a text exporting feature.
